Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

This exercise really gave me an idea of how the game physics 
works and it was really magical to see something work so beautifully.

This was a very very knowledge bearing exercise which taught me 
a lot about collisions. It is still a little hazy but I get it.

I now should be able to complete my game by this friday.

Thank you.
